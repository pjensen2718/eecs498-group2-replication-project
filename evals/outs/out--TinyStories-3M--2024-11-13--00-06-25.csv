Roxy loved to climb. She climbed trees, rocks, and*** even leaves to see the other animals. Roxy was very happy to be there. Every day she would go to the forest to show everyone her big jump to her. \n\nOne day, Roxy saw a small hole in the forest. She wanted to explore, so she climbed inside her hole. She saw a lot of animals and wanted to come with them. When she got closer, Nadoxy heard a tiny sound. She saw a tiny bird singing, and they were all looking at her. They were all so small! \n\nBut then, Roxy realized something was wrong. She heard a tiny voice calling out. It was an old bird that needed help. Roxy thought a bird with a small beaver she would need help. \n\nSo, on her mission, Roxy found a way to help. She pulled out two little eyes, and tied one hand to the bird. The bird said, ""Good bird, Roxy, you are very kind. Keep going on high!""\n\nRoxy smiled and ran off with her big, shiny and free deer. She knew it was a special kind of treat. With those help, it was easy to see the land, and as she was looking up at the bird, she was able to get it. She was very happy to have shown it to her friend the rest of the forest.\n"|"The student's story displays some creativity but has several areas that need improvement. \n\n1. **Grammar and Syntax**: The story has numerous grammatical errors and awkward phrasings. For example, phrases like ""climbed inside her hole,"" ""Nadoxy heard a tiny sound,"" and ""a bird with a small beaver she would need help"" are unclear and grammatically incorrect. These issues make the story difficult to follow.\n\n2. **Completion of the Sentence**: The sentence split by the separator ""***"" is not completed correctly. It begins with ""Roxy loved to climb. She climbed trees, rocks, and*** even leaves to see the other animals."" The continuation does not fit seamlessly or logically after the conjunction ""and.""\n\n3. **Consistency and Story Development**: The story is inconsistent. Roxy's behavior, like climbing into a hole and helping the bird in such an abstract and unexplained way, lacks logical development and coherence. Moreover, concepts like ""pulling out two little eyes"" are confusing and nonsensical in the context of the story.\n\n4. **Creativity and Originality**: While there is an attempt at creativity, the execution falls short due to lack of clarity and coherence.\n\nOverall, the student needs to work on grammatical correctness, continuity, and clarity to effectively communicate the storyline."|3.0|5.0|4.0|3.0|C (6-7)

For example, the sentence ""Don't worry, but I can help you"" should not include ""but"" in this context.\n\n2. **Completion of the Sentence**: The student did not complete the sentence that was split by the separator ***. The sentence starts with ""She climbed trees, rocks, and*** even the ground,"" but the continuation after the separator shifts abruptly without logical completion.\n\n3. **Consistency with the Beginning**: The story lacks consistency with the beginning. It starts with Roxy the rhinoceros who loves to climb, but then abruptly shifts to a character named Leo who has lost a toy. It seems disconnected from the established setting and context.\n\n4. **Creativity**: While the student introduces a new element (Leo losing a toy), the transition between ideas is jarring and disrupts the narrative flow. The conclusion feels rushed and lacks coherence with the established story.\n\nOverall, the story requires significant revision to address grammatical errors, complete the fragmented sentence, and ensure consistency with the narrative's beginning."|3.0|4.0|2.0|3.0|C (6-7)

The storyline is disjointed and lacks logical progression, making it difficult to follow.\n\n3. **Consistency with Beginning**: The student did not successfully complete the sentence split by the separator. The phrase ""and felt very tall"" does not logically follow the split sentence, which disrupted the narrative's flow. Moreover, the story veers off into Roxy's eating habits without a clear connection to the initial setup of Roxy's love for climbing.\n\nOverall, the student needs to address grammatical errors, create a cohesive narrative, stick to the initial themes introduced, and ensure creative storytelling."|3.0|4.0|2.0|3.0|B (4-5)

All of a sudden, Roxy fell down and landed on the ground with a thud. He quickly looked so sad and hurt.\n\nRoxy felt very sorry for Roxy's mistake and apologized for trying to do something she had been given up. She learned to always remember to be grateful for who she was. Roxy promised to always keep doing her climbing so that she could gain from any weight, and get better. From that day on, Roxy always remembered to keep her weight on a sharp tree for many days, and always made sure to help her do everything possible.\n|"The student's completion of the story is lacking in several areas. \n\n1. **Grammatical Issues**: There are multiple instances of grammatical errors, such as inconsistent tense usage (""He quickly looked"" instead of ""She"", ""be grateful for who she was"" without subject clarity), and awkward phrasing (""carry onto the weight of her body"").\n\n2. **Logical Consistency**: The narrative is somewhat confusing and lacks logical consistency. The sentence ""Roxy didn't find her way down, so she found her own weight"" is unclear in meaning. Additionally, the actions and consequences are not coherently linked, such as Roxy apologizing to herself.\n\n3. **Sentence Completion**: The sentence split by the *** (""Roxy loved to climb. She climbed trees, rocks, and*** even her own mountain trees."") is not completed logically; the continuation seems redundant and does not enhance the story.\n\n4. **Creativity and Originality**: The story attempts to convey a moral lesson about acknowledging one's abilities and limitations, but it does so in a muddled way.\n\n5. **Consistency with Initial Story**: The continuation does match the theme of climbing indicated in the initial segment, but the narrative is disjointed, making it hard to follow or appreciate any development in plot or character.\n\nOverall, the student's story completion requires significant improvement in coherence, grammatical accuracy, and logical narrative flow to meet the exercise's requirements effectively."|4.0|5.0|4.0|3.0|C (6-7)

For example, ""Max danced but then he started to complain that he wanted something nice"" could be refined for clarity and flow.\n\n2. **Consistency with the Beginning**: The student does not effectively complete the sentence split at the ""***"" separator. The transition from ""Max had a red collar that he wore"" is abrupt and disjointed; the expected continuation about the collar is missing. Instead, the student jumps to a new narrative involving the mouse and treats, losing the initial focus on Max's collar.\n\n3. **Creativity and Coherence**: While the story introduces new elements like Whiskers the mouse and treats, it lacks logical coherence and emotional depth. The relationship dynamics between Max and Whiskers are introduced but not fully explored or resolved, leaving a feeling of incompleteness.

So, Mia and Tom both ran away.\n|"The student's story completion shows creativity but has several issues. \n\n1. **Grammar and Language:** \n   - The story contains grammatical errors, such as the incorrect use of ""he"" instead of ""she"" regarding Mia.\n   - Phrases like ""so many special clothes"" and ""something bad needed to wear"" are awkwardly constructed and confusing.\n   - Sentence structure is often simple, which is appropriate for certain levels, but some parts are also confusing and inconsistent.\n\n2. **Consistency with the Exercise:**\n   - The completion diverges from the conventions of storytelling, including abrupt plot developments, such as the sudden introduction of a monster at the park, without sufficient buildup or integration with prior elements.\n\n3. **Consistency with Story Beginning:**\n   - The continuation of the sentence from the beginning with ""of pretty jewelry that was made of silver"" is somewhat adequate, though undeveloped.\n   - The link between the enjoyment of jewelry and the abrupt monster scenario lacks a coherent transition, suggesting a need for better narrative flow and logic.\n\nOverall, the student demonstrates an imaginative approach but needs to work on grammatical accuracy, narrative cohesion, and clearer, more consistent storytelling."|4.0|5.0|3.0|4.0|C (6-7)
8|Once upon a time, there was a girl named Mia. Mia loved her jewelry. She had a big box full|"Once upon a time, there was a girl named Mia. Mia loved her jewelry. She had a big box full*** of jewelry. One night, Mia was playing in the park when she saw a butterfly. The butterfly was very pretty and smelled very nice for her. \n\nMia decided to go on a wild adventure. She put her necklace on a leaf and ran outside. She saw some pretty flowers and decided to count them. \n\n""I'm counting,"" Mia said. ""One, two,"" and the butterfly counted out a lot of butterflies. Mia was very proud of herself for counting. \n\nBut then, one of the butterflies came towards them. The butterfly said, ""Please, let me join you."" Mia felt sad but sad. \n\nJust then, a big gust of wind blew and the butterfly tried to pinch Mia. She screamed and fell down. The butterfly said, ""Stop pinched me!"" Mia was shocked. She grabbed the butterfly in her mouth and took it home. \n\nMia was still happy she was able to count on the butterfly. She was proud that she could count on her mom for a long time. From that day on, Mia always remembered to count and seek with a little bird.\n"|"The student's story after the ""***"" separator shows some creativity but lacks coherence and clear progression. The sentence completion right after the separator does not seamlessly connect with the initial part, as it leads to a non-sequitur about playing in the park, rather than detailing more about the jewelry. Grammatically, there are issues such as ""smelled very nice for her"" and ""sad but sad,"" which suggest repetition and awkward phrasing. The narrative itself is inconsistent, containing abrupt shifts in action and logic, particularly with the butterfly and counting scenes. Additionally, parts of the story, such as ""took it home"" and ""count on her mom for a long time,"" introduce themes that feel disconnected from the overall plot, making it challenging to follow a structured storyline. Overall, the story does not fully meet the requirements of the exercise, as it struggles with coherence, grammar, and narrative continuity."|4.0|6.0|3.0|3.0|C (6-7)
8|Once upon a time, there was a girl named Mia. Mia loved her jewelry. She had a big box full|"Once upon a time, there was a girl named Mia. Mia loved her jewelry. She had a big box full*** of jewelry. One day, Mia decided to help her mommy.\n\nMia went to her mommy's room and said, ""Mommy, I'm done cleaning! Can I help you clean this up, please?"" Her mommy smiled and said, ""Of course, Mia. Now let's clean up together and we will clean up.""\n\nAfter they finished cleaning, Mia looked around her room. She saw the pretty jewelry everywhere. She was so happy and showed it to her mommy. ""Look, mommy! I made this for you and my jewelry now. Thank you, Lily!""\n\nMia's mommy smiled and said, ""Thank you, Mia. You are a great helper."" Mia was happy and said, ""I am also helping you, Mommy.""\n\nFrom that day on, Mia and her mommy helped clean and always found things to help fix.\n"|"The student's story after the *** separator is generally grammatically correct, though there are a couple of awkward phrasings and repetitions, such as ""and we will clean up,"" which could be more concise. The story is consistent with the requirements of the exercise in that it continues the narrative and displays creativity in Mia's interaction with her mother. However, the transition from the given beginning is slightly disjointed. The sentence split by the separator ""*** of jewelry"" leads into a new idea without completing the prior thought, making it less coherent at that transition point. The completion relates to the beginning, maintaining the focus on Mia‚Äôs love for jewelry and adding a subplot about helping her mother, but the plot development is somewhat simplistic and could benefit from more depth or complexity. Overall, the story aligns with the exercise's intent but could be improved with smoother transitions and more elaborated narrative elements."|7.0|6.0|5.0|5.0|C (6-7)

She had a big box full*** of jewelry. Mia's mommy said they could supply her jewelry together.\n\nMia and her mommy went to the store and borrowed some jewelry. Mia was very happy. She put on her new jewelry box and started to dance along. She danced and twirled in the mirror. \n\nMia twirled to dance with her jewelry that the bracelet went on. Her mommy would say it was really much fun. One day they went to the park to play outside in the sun.

Her mommy smiled and said, ""Now you can twirl and twirl it around!"" Mia was so happy. \n\nMia and her mommy spent the rest of the day playing and having fun. It was the best day ever!\n"|"The story written by the student is a simple and imaginative continuation of the beginning. However, there are some issues to address:\n\n1. **Grammar**: The story contains several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing. For example, ""Mia twirled to dance with her jewelry that the bracelet went on,"" is unclear and needs revision for clarity.\n\n2. **Sentence Completion**: The student did not complete the sentence split by the separator ""***"". The phrase ""a big box full"" was left unfinished.\n\n3. **Consistency with the Beginning**: The continuation is not entirely consistent with the beginning. The initial sentence after ""***"" mentions borrowing jewelry from a store, which contradicts typical purchasing behavior and the notion of supplying jewelry together.\n\n4. **Creativity**: The story shows creativity, especially with the depiction of Mia's joy and playful interactions with her jewelry in different settings.\n\n5. **Consistency with Exercise Requirements**: The student attempts to create a coherent narrative, but the story lacks a strong connection to the original sentence and coherence throughout.\n\nOverall, while the student's work displays creativity, it requires improvement in grammatical accuracy, sentence completion, and consistency."|4.0|7.0|5.0|5.0|C (6-7)
